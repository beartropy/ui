# Contributing to Beartropy UI

Thank you for considering contributing to Beartropy UI! The contribution guide can be found in the [Beartropy documentation](https://beartropy.com/contributing).

## Bug Reports

To encourage active collaboration, Beartropy strongly encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. "Bug reports" may also be sent within the form of a pull request containing a failing test.

However, if you file a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and fix it.
